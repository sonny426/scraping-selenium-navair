    "description": "Description:\nThe CH-53K is a fully shipboard-compatible derivative design of the existing CH-53E using mature technology for Marine expeditionary heavy-lift assault transport of armored vehicles, equipment and personnel.\nFeatures:\nThe CH-53K will remain within the same shipboard footprint, while providing much greater lift, reliability, maintainability, and cost of ownership improvements. The new-build CH-53K will provide the Joint Task Force commander with double the capability of the CH-53E, thus supporting our Seapower 21 operational concepts with the ability to transport Dual Heavy HMMWVs (armored) and Light Armored Vehicle & MEFFV (LAV variant).\nBackground:\nThe CH-53K is a JROC-certified requirement needed today by the Marine Corps to meet its critical amphibious assault mission. Analysis conducted by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command indicates the current CH-53E will not support the Marine Corps\u2019 Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare concepts we intend to employ in the 2015 timeframe. Those concepts call for sea basing logistics, and command & control that will require far more vertical lift than we currently possess. In addition, operation and support costs, as well as maintainability and reliability rates, of the CH-53E are unacceptable and can only be fixed through a rigorous re-design. An independent Analysis of Alternatives conducted in 2003 determined a new-build derivative of the robust, proven CH-53E was the most cost-effective approach compared to new design/new platform, service life extension or remanufacture alternatives.\nMarinized heavy lift helicopters have consistently proven their worth to the Marine Corps with their versatility and range. In recent history, during Operation Eastern Exit two CH-53Es launched from amphibious ships and flew 463 nautical miles (532.45 miles) at night, refueling twice enroute, to rescue American and foreign allies from the American Embassy in the civil war-torn capital of Mogadishu, Somalia in January 1990. Two CH-53Es rescued Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady in Bosnia in June 1995. Currently, CH-53E\u2019s are deployed globally in support of the Global War on Terror providing critically needed heavy lift in Iraq and the Horn of Africa.\nService:\nUnited States Marine Corps\nPoint of Contacts:\nNaval Air Systems Command\nHeavy Lift Program Office\n47123 Buse Road Bldg. 2272,\nSuite 162 Patuxent River, MD 20670\n(301) 995-2774\nGeneral Characteristics:\nPayload/Range: 27,000 lbs to 110 nm (40% improvement over CH-53E)\nDeployment (IOC): 2015 (2014 possible)\nPlanned Buy: 156 (Plus 5 test a/c)\nEstimated Unit Cost: $42.1 Million ($FY03)"

    "title": "CEC Cooperative Engagement Capability",
    "description": "Description:\nCooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) is designed to enhance the Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) war fighting capability of ships and aircraft by the netting of battle force sensors to provide a single, distributed AAW defense capability. As a key pillar of the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability, CEC enables Integrated Fire Control to counter increasingly capable and less detectable cruise missiles and manned aircraft, and in the future, tactical ballistic missiles in a joint environment.\nFeatures:\nCEC is a system of hardware and software that allows the sharing of radar data on air targets among ships and aircraft. Radar data from individual ships and aircraft of a Strike Group are transmitted to other units in the group via a line-of-sight, Data Distribution System (DDS). Each platform uses identical data processing algorithms resident in its Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP), resulting in each having the same display of track information on aircraft and missiles. An individual ship can launch an anti-air missile at a threat aircraft or anti-ship cruise missile within its engagement envelope, based on data relayed to it by another ship.\nBackground:\nThe capability provided by CEC brings significant benefits in all air defense areas, including: track accuracy, continuity, and ID consistency; reduced reaction time and extended engagement ranges. CEC serves as a major enabler of a single integrated air picture and provides the fleet with the defensive flexibility required to confront the evolving threat of anti-ship cruise and theater ballistic missiles. By fusing the sensor data of each ship and aircraft into a single, real-time composite track picture, CEC significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare and theater air defense capabilities.\nService:\nNavy-ACAT \u2013 1D\nPoint of Contacts:\nProgram Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS)\nCommand and Control Directorate, PEO IWS6.0\n1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.
